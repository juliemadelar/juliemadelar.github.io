                    <h1>Privacy Policy for Timelogger</h1>
                    <p>Last Updated: March 2025 </p>
                    <p>
                    We are committed to protecting your privacy while also improving our App. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our [Your App Name] mobile application (the "App").
                    </p>
                    <ul>


                   <li> 1. Data Collection and Storage</li>
                    
                    Local Storage: Primarily, all data generated or used within the App is stored locally on your device, unless you explicitly choose to share it through your device's built-in sharing functionalities (e.g., email, messaging).
                    Analytics Tracking: To improve the App's performance and user experience, we may use analytics services, such as Google Analytics for Firebase. This service may collect anonymous usage data. This data helps us understand how users interact with the App, identify areas for improvement, and troubleshoot issues.
                    Google Analytics for Firebase: This service may collect information such as device identifiers, usage patterns, and crash reports. This data is aggregated and anonymized, and we do not use it to identify individual users. You can review Google's privacy policy at [Google Privacy Policy URL].
                    No Server Storage of Personal Data: We do not transmit or store any of your personally identifiable data on our servers or any third-party servers, outside of the anonymized and aggregated analytics data mentioned above.
                    <li>2. Permissions
                    File Permissions for data storage</li>

                    <li>3. Sharing Your Information
                    
                    Analytics Data: We may share aggregated and anonymized analytics data with Google Analytics for Firebase to analyze App usage.
                    No Sharing of Personal Data: Because we do not collect any personal data, we do not share any personal data. Any sharing of data that occurs would be done by the user themselves, through the use of their device's native sharing functions.
                </li>
                    <li>
                    4. Data Security
                    
                    Local Data: Since much of the data is stored locally on your device, you are responsible for the security of your device. We recommend that you use strong passwords and keep your device software up to date.
                    Analytics Data: Google Analytics for Firebase employs industry-standard security measures to protect the data it collects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    5. Children's Privacy
                    
                    Our App is designed for general audiences and is not specifically targeted at children under the age of 13. Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information, we do not knowingly collect such information from children under 13.
                </li>
                <li>
                    6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
                    
                    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Â

                    Transparency: It is crucial to be transparent about any analytics tracking you implement.
                    Google Play Requirements: Ensure that your app adheres to all Google Play Store policies and guidelines, especially regarding data collection and user consent.
                    Legal Advice: This is not legal advice. Consult with a legal professional to ensure your Privacy Policy complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
                    User Consent: If required by law, ensure you obtain proper user consent for analytics tracking.
                    Third party libraries: If you use third party libraries, ensure that you understand their data collection practices, and that those practices are reflected in your privacy policy.
                    Google Analytics specifics: If using google analytics, read the google analytics for firebase documentation, and ensure you are in compliance with their terms of service.
